    "# Maris: Fine-Grained Policy-Guided Safeguards Demo \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Maris?\n",
    "Maris, a fine-grained policy-guided safeguards system for AG2 multi-agent applications. Based on a research paper in [Safeguard-by-Development: A Privacy-Enhanced Development Paradigm for Multi-Agent Collaboration Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04799), Maris provides granular security control over inter-agent communication and environment interactions (those with tools, llms, and users).\n",
    "\n",
    "Maris can add security controls in both **inter-agent communication** and **agent-environment communication**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Supported Policy Types:**\n",
    "- **Inter-agent policies**: Control what information flows between specific agents (e.g., mask patient data from planner agents)\n",
    "- **Agent-environment policies**: Control interactions between agents and their environment (tools, LLMs, users)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Backend Implementation**: Maris internally uses existing AG2 guardrails for detection, automatically selecting and configuring the appropriate guardrail (regex or LLM-based) based on your policy specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Maris Policy Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
